# bBEANS

The name was originally an acronym for `blog BOOTSTRAP EXPRESS ANGULAR NODE SQLITE`, standing for a easy to use, smart and simple blog cms using the technologies above. As web development is quickly evolving, we are currently relaunching the project and may use different technologies. On the other hands we like beans, so the name will stay. Eat it!
