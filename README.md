# Be mean, Blog mean!
b_MEAN is a blog engine based on the [MEAN.js](http://meanjs.org/ "MEAN.js") Stack. Simple, clean, MEAN.

**IMPORTANT: This project is still in production and absolutely unfinished yet.**

Why use b_MEAN? Here's the plan:

- fast and flexible database powered by MongoDB
- server completely written in Javascript with node.js and express.js
- nice and clean REST API, open for external use
- tidy backend with Bootstrap
- spicy and modern design with AngularJS
